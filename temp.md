# 📊 Understanding OpenTelemetry vs General Instrumentation (Prometheus)

## 🧠 What Was the Question?

> **"Why use OpenTelemetry (OTel) when we can collect metrics directly using Prometheus exporters or general instrumentation?"**

This README explains that question, compares both approaches, and clarifies where and how OpenTelemetry fits in modern observability.

---

## 🔍 What Is OpenTelemetry?

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) is an open-source observability framework that provides **standardized APIs and SDKs** to collect:

- 📊 **Metrics**
- 📄 **Logs**
- 🔍 **Traces**

It works across multiple programming languages and supports exporting data to various backends like **Prometheus**, **Jaeger**, **Elastic**, and more.

## 🔄 OpenTelemetry in the Observability Flow


You write instrumentation in your code using OTel’s APIs, then export the data to your preferred monitoring tool.

## ⚖️ General Instrumentation vs OpenTelemetry

| Feature | General Prometheus Instrumentation | OpenTelemetry |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Metrics support | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tracing support | ❌ | ✅ |
| Logs support | ❌ | ✅ |
| Standardized API | ❌ | ✅ |
| Auto-instrumentation | ❌ | ✅ |
| Backend flexibility | ❌ Prometheus-only | ✅ Prometheus, Jaeger, Elastic, etc. |
| Distributed tracing | ❌ | ✅ |
| Future-proof observability | ❌ | ✅ |

## ✅ Example Breakdown

### General Prometheus Instrumentation:

```js
// Using prom-client
const client = require('prom-client');
const counter = new client.Counter({ name: 'http_requests_total', help: 'HTTP requests' });
counter.inc();

# OpenTelemetry Instrumentation:
'''bash
const { MeterProvider } = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-metrics');
const { PrometheusExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-prometheus');

const exporter = new PrometheusExporter({ port: 9464 });
const meterProvider = new MeterProvider();
meterProvider.addMetricReader(exporter);

const meter = meterProvider.getMeter('my-app');
const counter = meter.createCounter('orders_placed');
counter.add(1);

# 🍔 Observability in a Food Delivery App — Prometheus vs OpenTelemetry

## 🧠 Imagine This: You Have a Food Delivery App

You’ve deployed it on Kubernetes, and you want to **monitor everything** — from the infrastructure to the actual app logic.

Let’s break down how Prometheus exporters and OpenTelemetry help — and where each fits in.

---

## ⚙️ Scenario 1: Using Prometheus Exporters (Infrastructure Level)

You install:
- `node_exporter` → Monitors CPU, memory, disk, etc.
- `kube-state-metrics` → Monitors Kubernetes objects like pods, deployments, and nodes

🧾 **What You Get:**
- CPU: 65%
- RAM: 4GB used
- Disk: 70% full
- Pod status: Running
- Deployment replicas: 3

✅ This tells you **how your platform is doing**

❌ But it **cannot** tell you:
- How many people placed orders
- What’s the API response time for `/checkout`
- Where errors happened across services

---

## 🧠 Scenario 2: Using OpenTelemetry (Application Level)

Now you go into your **application code** and do this:

```js
const counter = meter.createCounter('orders_placed');
counter.add(1);

const histogram = meter.createHistogram('checkout_duration_ms');
histogram.record(350); // 350ms
